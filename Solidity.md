* To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile myToken.sol" button.

* Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "myToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

* Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by copying the account on the upperleft then paste it to burn or mint, and then put any value you want. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function. You can click the totalSupply button to see how many tokens you mint or burn.
